# Color_Picker

This is a simple color picker application that allows you to change the background color of a container and displays the selected color's hexadecimal code.

## About

I created this project as part of my learning journey in JavaScript. It serves as a practical exercise to apply JavaScript concepts while building a useful application.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open html file in your web browser.
3. Click one of the color buttons to change the background color:
   - "Grey" button sets the background color to #e0e0e0.
   - "Green" button sets the background color to #6fcf97.
   - "Blue" button sets the background color to #56ccf2.
   - "Purple" button sets the background color to #bb6bd9.

The hexadecimal code of the selected color will be displayed below the container.
